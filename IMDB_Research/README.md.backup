# IMDb and non-American movies : a dataviz research
### How do foreign movies make it in the USA ? 

In collaboration with Nils Loiseau, we researched about the place of non-American movies in the Internet Movie Database and influence from the American cinematographic industry.

We used data-visualization to highlight our main findings and give insight to our hypothesis.

This project is an assignment made for the [*Design for Data and Information Visualization*](http://formation.sciences-po.fr/enseignement/2019/ocom/2585) class in Sciences Po Paris.

## Built With

#### Analyzing Data

- [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) - a spreadsheet software

- [Open Refine](https://openrefine.org/) - data cleaning and transformation software

#### Visualizing Data

- [Raw Graphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) - a data-visualization framework

- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/fr/products/illustrator.html) - a vectorial graphic creation software

#### The dataset

[//]: # (add data_head)

The dataset contains :

- 4064 entries
- 18 categories

What we want to study : movies geographical diversity 

Our first goal : link this geographial data to other economical data (revenue, budget) and cultural data (genres, keywords, overview)

In the meantime : study relationship links between countries via co-productions

The first project draft : make a world map representing countries producing movies, their interactions and their cultural characteristics

#### First problem encountered

[//]: # (add open_refine_first)

After a first exploration of the data on Open Refine, we realize USA's weight over the dataset : more than half (and not counting co-production)of the movies present in the dataset are produced by the USA.

Proportion of foreign movies is really low and not enough representative from countries present in the dataset.

Therefore, we can say that the dataset represents the American film market : its productions but also and above all its consumption - which we can analyze through vote-average and revenue.

#### Thinking process

This representation bias from the dataset can be useful for us into guiding our research towards another angle : we can analyze how a foreign movie can be successful in the USA.

Even more interesting, this USA weight over the dataset is also explained by the weight of its coproduction with foreign countries.
Do these coproductions influence cultural norms from foreign movies ? Do they increase their chance to be successful ? 

**Research questions :**

What are the ingredients of success for a foreign movie in the American box-office ?

How does a foreign movie make it in the USA ?

#### Datas which are gonna interest us

**Identity:** genres, keyword, original\_language, overview, production\_country, spoken\_language

**Technical:** budget, crew, production\_company, runtime

**Impact:** revenue, popularity, vote\_average, vote\_count

#### Cleaning the data

[//]: # (cleaning data image)

First step : cleaning the dataset

Check for adding errors, empty cells, unvalid formats...

#### Research plan

##### Foreign movies "cultural" analysis

What are the norms from foreign movies who make it in the USA ? <br>
*Data : genres, themes (keywords, overview), runtime*

What are the norms from *very good* foreign movies (among the first two deciles from the dataset)

##### American movies "cultural" analysis

What are the norms from american movies ? <br> *Data : genres, themes (keywords, overview), spoken\_language and original\_language, runtime*

What are the norms from *very good* American movies (among the first two deciles from the dataset)

##### Comparative analysis

Are norms from *very good* foreign movies different from *very good* American movies ?

Do foreign movies should adapt their cultural content for American market ?

- Do they adapt languages spoken in the movie ? 
- What about themes and genres ? 
- Are movies radically different from American standards well received in the USA ?


Does the cooperation with USA make foreign movies more popular ? 

- Does it make a budget difference in comparison with *100%* foreign movies ?
- Are coproduced movies better received by the American market ?
- Does this coproduction adapts movies cultural norms ? Is there a difference in genres and themes in comparison with *100*
